Single-page responsive portfolio & contact site built from the HTML5 UP "Big Picture" template, refactored for performance, accessibility, and maintainability.

## Key Features
## Key Features
- Fast initial load (deferred JS, image lazy loading, font + hero preloads)
- Mobile-first responsive layout with persistent top navigation
- Lightbox gallery powered by Poptrox
- Scroll-triggered reveal animations via Scrollex (About section stays visible after first reveal)
- Accessible semantic HTML (landmarks, descriptive alt text, placeholder labels)
- Contact form integrated with Formspree

## Tech Stack
- HTML5, CSS3 + Sass (`assets/sass` sources compiled to `assets/css/main.css` & `main.min.css`)
- jQuery + lightweight plugins (Poptrox, Scrollex, Breakpoints, Browser utils)
- Font Awesome (self-hosted webfonts subset)

## Performance / Optimization Notes
- Removed unused smooth scrolling plugin (`jquery.scrolly`) for immediate anchor navigation
- Images use `loading="lazy"` & `decoding="async"`; hero images preloaded for LCP
- Critical fonts & hero images preloaded; Google Fonts uses `display=swap`
- Minified production stylesheet `main.min.css` generated via Sass

## Structure Overview
```
index.html
assets/css/            # main.css (expanded), main.min.css (compressed build output)
assets/sass/           # Modular Sass source
assets/js/             # Core JS + plugins
images/                # Portfolio images (full + thumbs)
other/                 # Logo, favicon, about image
package.json           # Sass build scripts
```

## Build (Sass)
Install dependencies (first time):
```powershell
npm install
```
Develop with watch:
```powershell
npm run sass:watch
```
One-off dev build (expanded) + production minified CSS:
```powershell
npm run build
```
Outputs:
- `assets/css/main.css` (readable)
- `assets/css/main.min.css` (compressed, referenced by `index.html`)

## Local Development
You can open `index.html` directly, or run a static server:
```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```
Visit: http://localhost:8000

## Updating Gallery
Add full-size images to `images/fulls/` and matching thumbnails to `images/thumbs/` with identical filenames. Then append new `<a class="gallery-img ...">` items in the gallery markup.

## Accessibility Checklist
- Descriptive alt text
- Sufficient color contrast (verify after palette changes)
- Keyboard navigable gallery & form
- Focus styles retained via browser defaults

## Deployment
Upload all files (including `assets/css/main.min.css`). No server build step required if you commit compiled CSS.

## Maintenance Notes
- Images are already optimized with WebP/AVIF variants for modern browsers
- Font Awesome glyphs could be further subset to reduce bundle size
- Consider adding CI for HTML/CSS validation + Lighthouse performance budget

## Changelog (highlights)
- fix(mobile): remove global touch blockers; improve iOS viewport height handling
- feat(layout): stack About image above text on small screens (Safari friendly)
- chore(html): move inline CSS/JS into `assets/css/overrides.css` and `assets/js/mobile-fixes.js`
